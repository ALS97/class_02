        <p>
            My name is Austin Smith. 
            At the time of writing this I am 22 years old.
             I was born into a military family and because of that, 
             I wasfortunate enough to spend almost 4 years in the UK. 
             I graduated from highschool in 2015 and attempted college twice, to no avail.
             Since graduation, I have worked as a waiter, cook, and bartender.
             While I enjoyed my work I felt it was time to start a career that would benefit me more than working in the service industry had.
             Through school I was most interested/succesful in engineering and robotics.
             I am much more hardware inclined than I care to admit.
             I plan to ammend this by becoming a software developer.
             My goals are to one day be able to build and code robots/prosthetic limbs.
